# Project
This program is designed to give users the ability to input and store information about tasks that they are currently working on 
or have completed. Initially you are met with a login screen which requires you to enter a valid username and password to use the program. 
Once you login you can either register a new user, add a task, view all tasks, or view just your tasks. When you add a task you are given 
a number of fields to enter associated with that task such as the task description, due date, and completion tracker. Additionally, you have
the option to edit existing tasks or mark them as complete. The program utilises a user interface to make it easy to use the program and its
features. The program is made using python with the tkinter GUI toolkit to create the user interface. 

# How to use 
This program runs on python and for that the python library is required. Most operating systems have the build in IDLE to run python programs, for reference look online or via the python documentation on official website.
